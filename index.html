    <h2>Why Maltese</h2>
    <p> Maltese are loving and a true companion for the right owner/s. 
	Maltese are light shedders and are acceptable pets for most allergy sufferers.
	The Maltese is a suitable indoor dog that thrives even in apartments and small confines.
	They are loving and protective of their owners. They are very smart and trainable. 
	In general, the Maltese is a healthy breed but be careful with their teeth they need to get brushed and taken care for.

    <h2>Availability and Waiting List</h2>
    <p> Our puppies are <b>first come first serve basis </b>  per the waiting list. There will be a <mark>$750 down payment</mark> to reserve the puppy.
	and the remaining balance will be paid on the release date of the puppy</p>
	<p>Females are rare these days so it is better to reserve the soonest and be on our waiting list. waiting time depends on when the litter can become available.</p>
	<p>They will be released after 12 weeks with vet checked and an AKC Registration.
	They are also Grass Pad/Pee Pad Trained but owners still need to make the training consistent until it's an automatic behavior for the puppy</p>
